# STACK

This repository contains python and C code for a Stack.

In C, the stack is implemented using a linked-list. This linked-list has an undefined length.
In python, the stack is implemented using a static array (implicit).

In both C and python, the main functions associated with stacks are implemented (pop, peak, push).
